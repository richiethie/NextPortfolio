# Building FilmShare: My First Community Platform

FilmShare was one of the first big projects where I truly stepped outside my comfort zone.

It wasn’t just about writing code — it was about creating a **space**.

A place for filmmakers, students, and hobbyists to share their short films, get feedback,  
and feel like they were part of something.

## 🎬 Where It Started

The idea came from conversations with friends in film school.

They needed:
- A simple way to **upload short films** (under 10 min).
- A platform to **get discovered** without fighting YouTube’s algorithm.
- A space to **connect with other creators**.

I realized — there wasn’t anything lightweight, community-driven, and focused purely on short films.

## 🏗️ How I Built It

For the stack, I went with:
- **Node.js + Express** for the backend.
- **MongoDB** for flexible data storage.
- **React** for the frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- Video uploads stored (initially) in the database, with plans to move to a CDN.

Some of the coolest challenges:
- **User auth & memberships** (free + premium tiers).
- Building a **ranking system** for top-rated films.
- Creating a **follow system** so users had a personalized feed.

## 🔥 What I Learned

The biggest takeaways?
- Building a community is **way harder** than building a product.
- Simple features (like search!) take real design thinking.
- People **care about speed** — especially when uploading video.

## 🌟 Looking Back

FilmShare taught me so much:
- How to think like a product designer.
- How to plan for scale.
- How to listen to users and iterate.

And most importantly — it showed me that building something people **care about** is the real win.

### 💭 Final Thoughts

FilmShare was more than just code.

It was my first real experience creating a product **for a community** —  
and it’s still one of my favorite projects to date.
