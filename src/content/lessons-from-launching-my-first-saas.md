# Lessons from Launching My First SaaS

Launching a SaaS product has been one of the most challenging — and rewarding — experiences of my career.

Here are a few hard-earned lessons.

## 🎯 MVP Means Ruthless Focus

It’s **so tempting** to keep adding features.

But every extra feature before launch:
- Delays feedback.
- Increases complexity.
- Risks missing the real user need.

## 💬 Talk to Users, Not Just Yourself

Early on, I made the mistake of building in isolation.

Once I started showing rough demos to people,  
I learned **more in two conversations** than in weeks of solo dev work.

## 📈 Marketing Is Part of Building

I used to think, *“If I build it, they will come.”*

Reality:
- Marketing is part of the product.
- Build in public.
- Share progress.
- Build an audience as early as possible.

### 🚀 Final Thoughts

SaaS is a marathon, not a sprint.

But with each launch, you get a little sharper, a little braver, and a little better at focusing on **what matters**.
