# Thinking of My Next Big Idea

Every great project I‚Äôve worked on has started with a single moment:  
that **spark** where an idea feels too exciting to ignore.

When I started brainstorming what would become BitDrop, I wasn‚Äôt aiming to build just another social app.  
I wanted to create something fun, shareable, and competitive ‚Äî but also **frictionless** for users.

Here‚Äôs a bit about how I worked through the process.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify what excites me

I asked myself:
- What apps do I actually **enjoy using** daily?
- What patterns do I see across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Discord?
- Where are people **already sharing content**, but maybe want a more focused space?

I realized I love short-form, viral, **fun** content ‚Äî but often wanted a way to share and rank memes just within my friend groups.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Spot the gap

I noticed:
- Group chats are messy for content sharing.
- There‚Äôs no real **private ranking** or ‚Äúmeme leaderboard‚Äù experience.
- People like to **compete**, even just for laughs.

I started imagining a platform where friends could drop content into a shared space  
and see **who‚Äôs winning the meme game this week**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Map the MVP

I sketched:
- Private + public groups.
- A **Vault** where users collect shared reels or memes.
- Simple upvote/downvote mechanics.
- Share-in from Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube Shorts.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Think about the stack

Since I love working across stacks, I leaned into:
- React Native for the app.
- Golang + Supabase for backend.
- PostgreSQL for structured data.
- Future AI integrations for ranking or moderation.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate the fun

Finally, I shared the idea casually with friends.

When people **laugh**, lean in, or immediately suggest ‚Äúoh, you should add X,‚Äù  
that‚Äôs when I know an idea has legs.

### üí≠ Final thoughts

The BitDrop idea was born not from market research, but from genuine **enthusiasm** and curiosity.

For me, that‚Äôs the real magic of starting something new.
