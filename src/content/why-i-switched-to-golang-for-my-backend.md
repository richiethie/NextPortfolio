# Why I Switched to Golang for My Backend

For years, Node.js was my go-to for backend development — fast, flexible, and JavaScript everywhere.

But after hitting some scaling challenges, I started experimenting with Golang,  
and honestly, it’s been a **game changer**.

## 🚀 Performance Matters

Go’s compiled nature and lightweight goroutines make it ideal for:

- High-concurrency workloads.
- APIs that need blazing speed.
- Projects where resource efficiency matters.

## 🛠️ Developer Experience

What surprised me most:
- The **simplicity** of Go’s syntax.
- Built-in tooling like `go fmt` and `go test`.
- Strong typing + clarity without the TypeScript setup overhead.

## ⚡ Real-World Wins

Since switching:
- API response times dropped by ~30%.
- Memory usage is lower.
- My dev workflow feels **cleaner and more predictable**.

### 💡 Final Take

I still love Node.js — but for certain projects, Go just feels like the right hammer for the job.
